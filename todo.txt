      | - lots of things in this list.
      |   most important is encoding 3 points using center that are simply
      |   n+o+1: where n is an axis, o is offset; this case center; and 1 defines unit form
      |   must update entire code structure for this one i knew i should have done this a long time ago
      |   with fast reference vectors any data can be reoriented to it's original state without a log
      |   and making a log can simply recover the array data (save data) making logs more simplistic
      |   the look at function will use a direction vector as a reference but the twist is entirely arbitrary
      |   and must rapidly change for ex: editing inside a polygon along it's lines that share no colinear normals
      |   grid orientation will be very automagical w/ these combined
      |   
      |   to avoid the arbitrary twist there must also exist a secondary rotation methodology
      |   rotate on the yaw to setup a second rotation in the pitch. emulate this with the continuity of quaternions ? right
      |   
      |   i started using points with lines and got to triangles but the reduction to triangles is essentially an indice map
      |   i now need to automate triangles back to lines to allow the joining of geometry assuming they share at least one point
      |   is this better than nesting ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
      |   
      |   
      |   EZ FIXES

      |   
      |   
      | - for now temp objs just make not delete
      | - sub folders need to be considered when cursor color to folder change
      | - sub folders need carry over when a folder duplicated
      | - 2d inds need to be fixed for translation/fns, maybe just pre-populate the vectors
      | - tree border width is opposite need to reverse w a 1-x
      |   
      | - arScale() should accept an array that determines what components are to be used in the computation reducing cpu (firefox)
      | - indicator for folder move is not always working -> so i found it works after using normal translation w/ v but not w/o using it 1time first?!??!
      | - also world points are visible through objects ?!?!?!?!? must split draw sequence into a before and after by pushing afters to a temp ar (faster)
      | - raises the question should all types be done this way ?
      |   
      |   
      |   ALL
______|___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
      | 
      | - all static data can be checked to group triangles coplaner -> resulting groups provide unique surfaces
      | - use the run list to create a ui for active modifiers -> data will end up in obj fns kinda big sad but maybe just use proper settings/functions string set
      | - 
      | - simple line plane intersection for rotation inside a plane would make a lot more sense and ig this would be the next evoltuion of pivot align run
      | - simple tool FAK: right click lock point (whenever cursor helper?) -> move point -> finish move -> write data
      | - reverse object geometry fn with mirror along the linked edges
      | - ball rotate tool where you select inside surface of ball with simple line/sphere
      |   - this would require pitch->yaw type of rotation. maybe settings for different types of rotation later
      | - pivot align can work with a cross vec holo
      | - shift v should block input from all obj's in 2d query
      | - short cuts for move obj||folder should both should cancel either -> entire key system needs rewrite fak
      | - multi-select w/ drag or in list or world
      | 
      | - temp objs can be deleted but crashes ofc. this could be a system if it notices upon deletion to undo that step..
      |   - deletion of any temp obj calls it's event (simple back) nah too complicated havent finished main features yet
      |  
      | - most obj fns could clone their opts -> generalize control struct
      |  
      | - i have forgotten the need for line/line intersections & line/mouse selection
      | - almost done w/ this one: need exclusion of self and reorganize the start of obj. ensure enable and active. kind of redundant..
      | - the functionRunList can contain color data that gets mapped later !!! GOOOOOD each Run obj will have two maps: obj [], col []
      | - or if there exists a color map the color can later be set directly ?
      | - 
      | - 
      | - if saves stored location, direction, zoom, and movement locks, a writing space becomes more accessible.
      | - mouse to world combined with a line/plane will work for drawing and not lag so much
      | - 
      | - 
      | - just make each obj store 3 directions that absorb rotation then reassume it's original
      | - default state -> conjugate???
      | - should be easy to revert change this way and keep a quat rot log essentially. assuming i can use their inverses w/ conjugate???
      | - this way i can select to translate w/ arrows and then swap between grid/translate -> circle/rotation w/ holograms
      | - might need to write something to test distance from point on circle (ez if predefined but bad in long term must be theoretical)
      | - oh just use origin o on plane and take delta vec and use that for angle selection. so lpi first.
      | - animated stackable logged quat rot holos in the end
      |
      | - per obj unit vecs saved data. aka all objects get additional data to absorb modification.
      | - k-d (theoretical) -> faster query for 3d world data. would replace 2d queries if distance from a line became faster this way. faster obj modif w/ nesting.
      | - chaikin's or something better lol -> repair some z buffer
      | - color map finish -> i'm keeping the pipeline as is. educational purposes initially. textures will come with entire rewrite. mat4's w/ libs approach.
      | - point nesting tool (auto sub-folder)
      | - some keybinds need to be event based ! rule set required
      |
      | - can a shader processing 4*n sets of data use a secondary set of modifiers and possibly a asin+bcos matrix 
      | - asin+bcos per entire diagonal -> a and b allow combined states of their weights in some way ?? to represent any rotation
      | - as a preprogrammable set of data generated by js that applies per obj rotation
      | - 
      |
      |
      |
      | - along axis when z is zero circles generated have incorrect center
      | - 
      | - bounding box should be relocalizeable
      | - 
      | - termination of the run list should remove all eLog stuffz but not tooo fast
      | - grid need a radial fade effect
      | - 
      | - soon can try simple algs like chaikin's
      | - something that can reduce surfaces to a set of smaller surfaces can help repair the accuracy of the depth buffer
      |
      | - fundamentally i'm missing differentation when applying tool struct w/ ui type w/ move fn w/ specific use
      | - to avoid always write a duplicate functional representation of the fundamental task any wide task such as all tools and their purpose.
      | - part of this is also the setup for key binds. there's no middle table.
      | - 
      | - z should undo a step in the pivot align
      | - 
      | - 
      | - elemental scroll directly w/ the div list
      |   - loop pointer map.layer 1 and 2 are first made end to end no grouping or make conversion
      |   - send data to array as they were passed, ex:

            makeElement(addButton, // fn -> (fn, params))
            { params }

      |   - 
      |   - 
      |   - 
      | - quats allow vector add/sub that; if sphereical arcing; allows preservation of direction. it's one motion. 
      | - auto z buffer top most
      |
      | - small menus
      | - start moving colors into array formats to allow pipe: load/modif col_ar sets -> col_ar set -> col_str set
      | -   
      |
      | - temp objs need to be grouped with an event identifier 
      | - try experiment w/ date now
      |
      | - fix opacity not working w/ no depth
      | - dupe folder should also dupe inner folders. Oh god help.
      | - fix opacity for line color change for objs in folder selected
      | - shift modifier for folder short cuts
      | - twist applied along axis by a sum of rotation
      | - connecting multiple lines or lines of different sizes ??? EDGE CONNECT
      | - point modification system
      | - bezier tool (requires way to connect sequences)
      | - menu overhaul (retarding progress w/o using scroll... draw out plan)
      | - measure angle (F to confirm 3 points)
      | - m_t_objs mem temp objects needs to be shown in tree as purple entry if points > 0
      | - mode for all lines / some lines / no lines
      | - paint still needs to be fixed so it doesn't continue a second line until key release
      |
      | - add C-s and C-o for files.
      | - need a temp 3d mem space for objects to be drawn as holos. color passed in for lines (keep simple?)
      | - maybe use my folder system to manage a non-interactable folder that contains temp objects?? Wait idk idk idk idk
      | - paint tool for tri's for the color map. ig color map will be in save file first step
      |
      | - maybe just for fun try an animated projectile that travels to hit location
      |
      | - need to use objects to connect w/ run list for most animated tools
      | - nominal lumber list ( need geo name for line objs )
      | - more fn obj conversion (doing trns obj) (fn done now fix rest of code)
      |
      | - add an animated world (floating cubes?)
      | - animations/physics ticks must be parallelizable for GPU or bad performance in the end
      |
      |
      | - multi select... ? already going via folder
      | -   so..
      | -   already have setup for obj tools w/ run & active checks
      | -   lame but could setup like this:
      | -     - replace instances of by obj index data modification to apply via list of i's
      | -     - then select stacking
      | -     - dynamic bounding highlight boxes per or for joint select
      | -   
      | -  
      | - need to try a fn that scales grid up and then back to where it was over 5ms do 5 scales
      | - ideally i use proper inverse to find mouse to world and I can use an offset/rounded lpi instead as well
      | - this help performance, reduce complexity, help clean up essentially.
      | -  
      | - i realize now to draw wire frame you can ray trace each vertex and when vertex shows behind remove connected lines.
      | -  
      | - KKKK static premade shaded color map -> during tri pack w/ new k find the correct col and pack to second dynam buffer -> look same & shaded
      | -  
      | - Make a pistol that shoots green lasers that bounce!
      | - Ray trace is done. Now to make it reflect and start a new trace -> keeps going until a defined amount of reflections.
      | - This would look cool inside a sphere! w/ no limit it'd probably crash
      | - physics engine should be possible but first I need to fix my triangles
      | - collision detections will need to borrow from the same idea of culling back faces
      | - but I will replace the tri actually with a bounding box
      | - so I first do check if they are close together then use dist to plane w/ dot simple
      | - if anything checks in adjust the objects velocities (rotational and position)
      | - collision's determine the angular velocity by distance from center
      | - apply standard gravity ticks
      | - collisions must always result in energy lost
      | - maybe all velocities and acceleration can be computed on the gpu or in a worker or both.
      | - a worker's latency may not matter if only left to manage some layers not visually noticeable
      | - the ground is defined by a positional min/max (no loop if below threshold)
      | - the ground can apply more dampening than obj to obj
      | - default amount of inverse angular velocity
      | -
      | - to get started setup the buffers
      | - box collision function and tests
      | - 
      | - 13.25, 13.625, 74.875
      |
      | - finish center inds?
      | - need parallel array manager to auto manage all the krap
      | - Menu updates need to be more efficient. Primarily updating selected item to curb tab alg proc
      | - Float32Array already contains byteLength and byteOffset.
      | - Match all of my data structure to use Float32Array to remove all type conversions
      | - fix preview image to offset w/ 2d forced square w/ check
      | - if encoded center is within plane of poly's captures some overlap
      | - engine space
        -- generate dir vec curves
      |
      | - nested point sequences at overlap point should be fairly easy. take note of logic
          - think i got it here
            - placing loop at a point implies to keep sequence continuity one additional point must be placed after loop insertion
            - len of loop does determine the need for the additional. I assume none or 1. may be 1 or 2.
            - logic diagram could provide more direct code struct
      |
      | - unique ids for objs will help w/ identical objs in future?
      |
      | - lock point offsets grid? could fix a lot of things w/ rmb select
      | - lmb in free mode is setting plane to inter_rnd for some reason..
          - when point locked the lpi is not being calculated with the arbitrary offset essentially
      |
      | - ? intersection reveal
          - doesn't have to be run all the time if the purpose is to model
          - line's checked for intersection within some range of it's len.
      |
      | - just noticed save data corrupted by single point data
          - temp fix is making all 1 point objs 2 equal points w/ center ig
      |
      | - all my functions relative to the plane can be replaced with a general obj orient fn.
      |
              might have the answer to this now with the new manual 2d gen circles
      |
      | - unit vector line conversion method for arc len
      |
      | So I guess I need to learn geometric algebra now. Quaternions are not even meta anymore.
      | Random idea ::
        | if I can clip a region of polygon's in 2d space creating two sets
        | -> i could then display them at two different fov's creating a zoomed region for scopes/sights
      | Obj cut hole { i could try using the link script on to the hole... }
        | i keep reusing my linear link. need to learn poly fill alg
        | i need to implement geometric obj creation.
        | with more layers of encoded data i can keep logs of what obj's are fundamentally

    All middle points of lines are free as I have encoded centers. Highlight center point on any obj w/ 2, 3 pts.
    Skeletal animation -> point interpolation. Long way to go I don't have interp maps yet. Do I really need to interp packed data??

  I can make real physgun by compounding quaternions and ray trace
  Make the planetary ico 
  Assault cube old code

  .reduce is a method that accumulates the values of an array into a single value (in this case, the sum of the squared components).

  Instead of clipping for side planes I could draw lines in two directions determined if x1>x2.... lol NO CLIPPING NEEDED
    for a lil extra travel just offset

  modulo distributes with switch with for loop ez wow for ex:

    for (i)
    {
      switch(i%3)
        case 0:
        case 1:
        case 2:
    }

    rayInterMap[] containing [Float32Array(4), Float32Array(4), ...] : clear entries upon calling another trace for now
    rayIMap[] populates data for poly loop to loop through allowing for poly color changes / indicators. Leading to a colorMap for tris.
      colors mapped as numbers converted by static array of colors.

    starting with 1 call to trace
    3 sides 3 vec a b c omni order thus equally in sign implies within poly

    sign is a/|a| , a/Math.abs(a) , Math.sign will be fastest? least ops w/ js calc sign
    for every entry, later refine to shorten loop. for ex: dot all [largest obj point from center (lrgp-ctr) premapped] w/ look_f (look dir)

      tri in order a b c (points) 

                b
               /|\         n from dataset: obj_normalMaps
              / n \
             a     c

                 b                     b                                     b
                /|\         =>        /|        <SHARED => SWAP SIGN>        |\
               / | \                 / |                                     | \
             a       c             a    (a-c)/2                       (a-c)/2    c

    maybe this is related in a sense to the barycentric coordinates. say I have a middle vector 
    point on poly can be on either one to confirm that it is inside 3 points
    two instances of comparing a series of signs IF the first one misses. So sometimes there is only one call! wow
    v01 = b-a                 ->        sub(b,a)
    v02 = (a-c)/2 - b         ->        sub(scale(sub(a,c),0.5),b)
    v03 = a - (a-c)/2         ->        sub(a, scale(sub(a,c),0.5))
    v11 = c-b                 ->        sub(c,b)
    v12 = (a-c)/2 - b         ->        sub(scale(sub(a,c),0.5),b)
    v13 = b - (a-c)/2         ->        sub(b, scale(sub(a,c),0.5))
    if     sign(a) == sign(b) || sign(b) == sign(c)   =>   push point to rayInterMap[] && rayIMap[]. wat

    - Make ray trace fn use inputs so I can call it to get data anywhere.

    - Cut obj in half by plane!
      intersect/ray trace w/ plane between pairs. Just remove any other points and keep the intersections. Not sure if I can do this so easily w/ point order being critical

    - For linking lines a tool to collapse a line into one axis would be fantastic. For a dynamic tool: use start & end to define the line and move points to that line.
    - Spiral tool OR line gen tool w/ inputs => same as spiral w/ the right settings

    - Enter key opens text overlay to search for function. goes like: [ENTER] type "link" [ENTER] -> link is member of table call it's function. Function stored in switch case calls obj_link();
      - and "link.k=l" rebinds link(); activator key to l. And if already bound swap. Block some keys maybe.
      - if any part of text is contained by a list of syntax display those options below and what options exist after the dot operator
      - find obj by would be amazing. by dist returns array of i's that will be modified w/ function 
      - this could provide the in game scripting w/o eval of js directly.
      - goTo(findBy).. bring(findBy).. scale(findBy)

    = Encode obj means into sectors by itor over x,y,z type loop with some set size by dividing size up into some number (4*4*4) => 64 sectors. Like a 2d grid but 3d.
      find their centers by excluding end and offset by half of number (2). map to table
        table
          [center pos, array of _i's]

  - just noticed flying toward a point w/ crosshair doesn't bring you to that point... Aim down fly backwards ends up on a 45?? can't remember if intentional

  - use a time delta for interpolation and player translation to avoid runtime speed fluctuations. so I need a timer for w a s d up down. 6 timers
    - after trying this i got the rubberbanding effect lol. client-server sync can fix.

  - research k-d tree / octree
  - Button to output linear obj to console. Model gun with game -> put into game -> model game with gun -> put into gun
  - The tab alg can be applied compression relative to center. like a 3d mesh impacting the screen creating a focal lense. this would actually slightly help differentiate object's that are close together IN 2D. maybe..

    Badly need to implement a struct system for tools generally such that every tool overrides some keys.
      Points should be a point tool (Place point - F)
      Circle tool (Place circle - F) (I need a later formula to compress a 4 point circle to align with the grid)
      Center Expand (Start/Finish applied as delta - F)
      Dynamic Expand (Applies compression/expansion with 3 input numbers)
      Rotate around Axis (For now input into box with deg. Use point and plane line)
      Stacker tool (Accepts distance and stacks) (Two input boxes)

    -	Use a bezier function of n points. Dynamic integral function to find the arc length. arc_l/n provides the sections to be influenced by perp vectors &&& the actual vertices of the curve. Divide by n and n/2. Go to n-n/2
    -	Maybe a separate self made api for handling the screen interface would be wise.
    -	3d/2d simple text obj generation for real notepad capacity. Easier to just store the string in the bg.
    -	Effects and sounds.

    // MAYBE SOME TIME IN 2053 (after christ)

    -	CLIPPING
    -	Add dancing stick figures to every vertex immediately. I will do this. Don't fuck with me.

    add clipping sides & what happens if 3 points where 1 is out ?
      total points goes from 3 to 4. This can happen n times per poly. How deal w/ data??????

    obj_select(_r); where _r is radius from center screen to screen space points. Same dot sequence to sort?
      how about auto group points to 3d sectors and a single ray trace reveals some any quantity of data within the block.
      inconclusive. Math implies computation. blocks can't fail. 

    Holy shit there's an algorithm for this lmao. This always happens to me.
