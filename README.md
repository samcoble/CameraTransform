Experimentation with the Camera Transform.

Inspired by Ken Joy's lecture series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpTl003EXCY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g)

Soon objects will be differentiable allowing objects to be spawned and manipulated.
I have kept the renderer simple for now but proper clipping will be done soon.

I do not use AI to generate any of my code.
This project is meant to be an endless exercise of mathematics as I add features. The camera transform is far less abstract than a fourier transform.
It will be very interesting to experiment with a 3D 'notepad' per se. One that can take on any idea and put it in 3D space. Spatial memory opposed to ?

500% Browser zoom created an interesting aesthetic.
