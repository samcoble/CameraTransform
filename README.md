Experimentation with the Camera Transform.

Inspired by Professor Kenneth Joy, and his lecture series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpTl003EXCY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g)

I have kept the renderer simple for now but proper clipping will be done soon.

This project is meant to be an endless exercise of mathematics as I add features. The camera transform is far less abstract than a fourier transform.
It will be very interesting to experiment with a 3D 'notepad' per se. One that can take on any idea and put it in 3D space. Spatial memory opposed to ?   



Finally I can make simple 3d models =)

Painting vertices with a line plane intersection. The beginning of object creation. At some point curvature will be a wide syntax.

Example of a new object being created at the aim location. Center screen currently does not align with the floor plane intersection :D
