Experimentation with the Camera Transform.

Inspired by Professor Kenneth Joy, and his lecture series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpTl003EXCY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g)

This project will need to be refactored before I continue adding features. WebGL shader functions have access to the GPU and it's ability to process in parallel. Ideally the back end webgl will be very small as it's only job will be to provide allocation and mathematical manipulation of float32Arrays to javascript. I would prefer to write this in C++ but html&javascript provide tremendous accessibility.


This project is meant to be an endless exercise of mathematics with the goal of developing intuition for the camera transform and the corresponding pipeline. 
It will be very interesting to experiment with a 3D 'notepad' per se. One that can take on any idea and put it in 3D space. Spatial memory opposed to ?

Save & Load FIXED. So far handling any large amount of junk!
- Move objects with (V) or (Shift+T) as well. (Shift-T) works in sequence with translation (V)
- Tab finds nearest obj and right click will find nearest point in the obj. Right click also finds any points you have placed that are not made into an obj yet.
- (L) links two objects of equal size linearly.

I'm starting to get distracted using this rather than writing any code lol.
There's no limit here. Make any tool you can dream of. I'm hoping to generate moldable meshes and maybe explore the use of procedural noise at some point. https://youtu.be/9kaIXkImCAM

Finally I can make simple 3d models =)

Painting vertices with a line plane intersection. The beginning of object creation. At some point curvature will be a wide syntax.

Example of a new object being created at the aim location. Center screen currently does not align with the floor plane intersection :D
